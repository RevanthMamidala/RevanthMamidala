# Revanth Mamidala
Hi there! I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the Water-Energy-Climate nexus and advancing eco-hydrological modeling to protect drinking water resources and promote sustainable agriculture. My current work focuses on drinking water treatment, fate and transport of nutrients, and developing Best Management Practices for drinking water protection in the face of climate change.

Previously, I conducted research on hydrodynamic modeling and glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) modeling and risk analysis, addressing critical challenges in water-related hazard assessment. Earlier in my career, my research centered on the circular economy, resource recovery, and wastewater treatment.

## Research Interests:
Broadly, I am interested in the dynamics of Water-Food-Energy nexus in future cliamatic and socio-economic conditions.
